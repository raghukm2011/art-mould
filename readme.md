Home Builder Digest is a national online magazine focusing on the residential housing industry.

Our Story

We are a group of builders, project consultants, and writers who are passionate about home construction and architecture. We recognized that there is a lack of well-researched, long-form, and geographically-focused information about contractors across various project types, so in 2016 began doing the research and publishing our findings. Our mission continues to be to help homeowners discover the right builder for their project, and to recognize those construction companies that have a proven track record of excellent craftsmanship.

Articles and Ranked Lists

Home Builder Digest publishes ranked lists of the best builders across the U.S. which follow a rigorous evaluation methodology based on more than a dozen criteria. Using licensing information, building permits, review sites, and contractors’ own webpages, our editorial team has built and maintains an expansive database on the work histories and capabilities of the best home builders across America. Learn more about how we determine the best builders and apply to be featured on our rankings page here. We thank getcensus.com for helping us manage our unwieldly contractor data set.

Finding the right builder

Over the years, many homeowners have reached out requesting personal recommendations for builders and free quotations for their projects. While we strive to create helpful ranked lists for every area in the U.S., we know that each project is unique in its location, budget, and scope, and that the builders featured in our articles may not always match each person’s needs. For anyone looking for personalized recommendations, we are happy to leverage our contractor directory and database to create a tailored list specifically for their project.

About Rosewood
For over three generations, Rosewood Home Builders has been helping individuals, couples and families build a better life. While many things have changed since our founding, one thing remains the same: our commitment to building quality and value into each of our homes …including yours.

The company’s President, Richard G. Rosetti got his start working under the direction of both his grandfather and father learning everything he could about home construction and the pride of craftsmanship. Rich continued his education at Siena College where he earned his bachelor’s degree in Business. From there he went on to work in both construction and real estate where he refined his skills. Rich then co-founded Rosetti Falvey Real Estate. Since then he has gone on to establish Richard G Rosetti Real Estate. Rosewood Home Builders was established in 1984. It began as a family owned business. It wasn’t until in 1997 that Rich took over as president and branched out on his own. In 2002, Rich moved Rosewood Home Builders to a new location at 1202 Troy Schenectady Road in Latham, NY. There, he expanded his staff and built a 4,000 sq. ft. Design Center, the largest in the Capital District.
